You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

SOLUTION:

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {

       int min_price = prices[0];
       int max_price = 0;
       int n = prices.length;

       for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        if(prices[i] < min_price) {
            min_price = prices[i];
        }
        else if( prices[i] - min_price > max_price) {
            max_price = prices[i] - min_price;
        }
       }

       return max_price;

    }
}
